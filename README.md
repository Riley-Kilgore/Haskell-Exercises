# Haskell-Exercises
These are exercises, (previously in the Exercises repository), that are now being put into Haskell Exercises Category.

I am using the book "Learn you a Haskell" to learn the content needed to solve different problems in Haskell, but as 
this book does not provide exercises to work I am using exercises from the repository at https://github.com/noelmarkham/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises
